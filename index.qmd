## How will our models run in the EDoN Toolkit? 

::: {.fragment}
* EDoN will produce many candidate models in the next 5 years
    + Using many incrementally collated data sources
:::
::: {.fragment}
* Each will have varying degrees of success - we want to choose the best ones
:::
::: {.fragment}
* We will focus on tracking model development to decide which ones are used in the final toolkit

## Why will tracking models help us? 

::: {.fragment}
* To keep us sane!
:::
::: {.fragment}
* To ensure we are accountable - our work is reproducible
    + i.e. is the toolkit running **model** V6.X.X against **data** V10.X.X?
:::
::: {.fragment}
* We have a commitment to depositing data and models on the ADDI Workbench
:::
::: {.fragment}
* If we ever have to double check a strange result from the toolkit we can

## Model = Data + Algorithm

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
- We have talked about data cleaning, **harmonization** etc... 
:::
::: {.fragment}
- All of these processes are part of the model pipeline
:::
::: {.fragment}
- It will take a **concerted** effort to bring all of this together

## All versioning is backed by our Gitlab

* Boards are pushed to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/edon-initiative/mlops/vetiver-workflow/) so we can share models easily

* Local **or** Continuous Integration / Continuous Development Deployment [(CI/CD)]()

## Initiating API {auto-animate="true"}

Deployment via [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) in R or a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) in Python

R
```{.r}
library(plumber)
pr() %>%
  vetiver_api(v) %>%
  pr_run(port=8000)
```

Python
```{.python}
from vetiver import VetiverAPI
app = VetiverAPI(v, check_ptype = True, port=8000)
```
